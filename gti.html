<p>Dodger Stadium established itself as an international venue in 1984 when it hosted the Olympics baseball competition. The eight-team competition averaged crowds of more than 48,000. The U.S. team, which was made up of college players such as future major leaguers Mark McGwire, pictured, left, Barry Larkin and Will Clark, won the silver medal. The Americans were defeated in the final by Japan, which included future seven-time Japanese league All-Star Yutaka Wada. Future Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez pitched for the Dominican Republic. Cuba was part of the Soviet Union-led boycott and didn't participate. In later years, Dodger Stadium hosted the opening ceremonies of the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival and the World Baseball Classic.Dodger Stadium was also the home of the Los Angeles Angels (now Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) from 1962 through 1965. To avoid constantly referring to their landlords, the Angels called the park Chavez Ravine Stadium (or just "Chavez Ravine"), after the geographic feature in which the stadium sits.</p>

Games were played near Carol Park and later at Union Grounds in the Williamsburg area. In 1862, Reuben Decker built a ballpark at the Capitoline Skating Lake. It followed the Union Grounds as only the second fenced-in ballpark. The Brooklyn Atlantics called Capitoline home until the area was developed and a street replaced the field in 1879.1879-90 Fans stand behind a rope along the left-field line to watch the Bridegrooms in 1887.Washington Park First professional game: May 5, 1884First National League game: April 28, 1890 Capacity: 4,500 Location: Between 3rd and 4th Streets at 5th Ave., Brooklyn, NYIn 1699, a Dutch immigrant named Claes Arentson Vechte built a stone house for his family in what was called the village of Gowanus within the old Town of Breukelen. In August 1776, General George Washington engaged the British for the first time in the Revolutionary War at the very same spot in what would be known as the Battle of Brooklyn. The British occupied Vechte's stone house and through its windows, fired their cannons, muskets and guns. The British won the battle, but lost the war.</p>
