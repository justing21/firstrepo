<p>A really, really deep rotation begins with one of the best left-handers of all-time, Sandy Koufax, who had a four-year stretch from 1963-66 -- his final four seasons -- that was as dominant as any pitcher ever. He won three Cy Young Awards in that span (and was third in the other). To fill out the rotation, you only have Cy Young Award or MVP winners. Vance, a Hall of Famer, played in the era before the Cy Young was awarded and was incredible in 1924. Hershiser set a record with 59 consecutive scoreless innings as he won the Cy Young in 1988, a record that still stands as of 2012. Sutton didn't win 20 games in 1972, but the Hall of Famer dominated on the way to his Cy Young. And we'll close it out with a young lefty whose best might be to come in Kershaw, who won the Cy Young in 2011 with a dominant season at age 23. Three won the Cy Young and didn't make the cut: Don Drysdale, Don Newcombe and Fernando Valenzuela. </p>

<p>Clayton Edward Kershaw (born March 19, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB).Kershaw is the youngest pitcher in history to win three Cy Young Awards, and he could be on track for a fourth in 2016. If so, he'd be just the fifth pitcher to win that many and would be doing it at a younger age than any of the others were at the time of their fourth -- Roger Clemens (35), Randy Johnson (38), Steve Carlton (37) and Greg Maddux (29).
Even more impressive is that Kershaw could be headed for a second National League Most Valuable Player Award to make him the first pitcher in 71 years -- and the fourth in history -- to win two. (The three pitchers to win multiple MVP Awards are Carl Hubbell (1933-36), Hal Newhouser ('44-45) and Walter Johnson ('13-24). All are in the Hall of Fame.)</p>
