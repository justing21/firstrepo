<p>A really, really deep rotation begins with one of the best left-handers of all-time, Sandy Koufax, who had a four-year stretch from 1963-66 -- his final four seasons -- that was as dominant as any pitcher ever. He won three Cy Young Awards in that span (and was third in the other). To fill out the rotation, you only have Cy Young Award or MVP winners. Vance, a Hall of Famer, played in the era before the Cy Young was awarded and was incredible in 1924. Hershiser set a record with 59 consecutive scoreless innings as he won the Cy Young in 1988, a record that still stands as of 2012. Sutton didn't win 20 games in 1972, but the Hall of Famer dominated on the way to his Cy Young. And we'll close it out with a young lefty whose best might be to come in Kershaw, who won the Cy Young in 2011 with a dominant season at age 23. Three won the Cy Young and didn't make the cut: Don Drysdale, Don Newcombe and Fernando Valenzuela. </p>
